AuthService:
	Oauth authentification process
		redirect to Auth with specific client id (Oauth app id)
		receive answer from Auth
		use answer to get access token
		use access token to get user credentials:
			github_id
			username // idk could be used to setup in game name directly
			email
		check existing
		if existing check 2FA activated
		else generate user_id (timestamp + number)


		register or login 
	auth from page username/email :
		login : 
				email | username : string
				password : string
			verify if email or username exist 
			and get data from db
			hash received password compare hash
			check 2FA
		register:
				email
				username
				password
				activate 2FA : bool
			check username validity
			check mail is potentialy a real mail // send confirmation link perhaps?
			password -> hash 
			generate user_id (timestamp + number)
		
	generate JWT or retrieve active from db 
		user_id
		+issued_at
		+expires_at
		+signature
		base64	
	put in cookie and send cookie to client ?

	2FA:
		generate secret code
		send mail to registered email with secret code inside
		api route to receive the code probably
		if code is valide continue auth 
		else retry or cancel ?

	API Gateway:
		intercept api calls extract JWT from cookie
		check JWT validity
			unbase64
			signature = hashed content
			expiration_date < Date.now();

		
		if valid
			put user_id into header
			forward request to corresponding microservice
		else
			return 401 or something
	

	DbManager:
		2 tables : 
		users 
			contains credentials
		OAuth_users 
			same but for Oauth users

	OnDisconnect
		delete the active JWT
